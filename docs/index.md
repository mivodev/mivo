## Why MIVO?

MIVO is a complete rewrite of the legendary **Mikhmon v3**, re-engineered to solve common performance issues on low-end hardware.

### Key Highlights

- **📱 Mobile First**: Fully responsive design that feels like a native app.
- **🔌 API First**: Built-in REST API with CORS support for 3rd party integrations.
- **🛠️ Developer Friendly**: Clean architecture, CLI tools (`php mivo`), and easy extension.
